# SXU-Software-Engineering-Ticket-Program-Project
This is my capstone project for Saint Xavier University Graduate Software Engineering Course.

This program will allow the user to select a movie and purchase tickets for it.
Afterwards, the user will be presented a seating chart to choose where they want to sit.
Then, they will be shown a receipt of purchase, their seating, and amount of tickets.

This is a NetBeans Project. Please use NetBeans to look at the source code.

I have added this to github for sharing purposes.
No changes will be made to this project.
